# MahTweets v4 - Lawrence Hargrave edition

A WPF Twitter Client for power Twitter users- possibly one of the oldest out there.

MahTweets is built in the style of a "shed project" - its something we tinker on in our spare time and things like process and UX are not a focus.

## A brief history of MahTweets

Paul Jenkins started a great Twitter client back in the day - it was a thing of wonderment in the early days of Twitter clients (particularly for Windows users).

As time passed, more people rallied to his cause - ideas were suggested, code was written, and great features were added to the app. The scope of MahTweets grew to being a rich social media client. Everyone's ideas were committed to code and binaries where shipped.

But, like all good things, it didn't last forever. MahTweets was officially retired in October 2011, and the code lived on Codeplex for people to view and fork.

## Enter MahTweets.LawrenceHargrave

I picked up the last build of [MahTweets 3.5.0.1569](http://mahtweets.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets) over on codeplex.com and started hacking on it. Forked it, if you will. In stealth mode.

And who is [Lawrence Hargrave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Hargrave)? Why use him for a codename?

1. He is Australian
2. He was a pioneer of flight, and specifically the box kite
3. Twitter / birds / flight
4. He did not patent any of his ideas
5. Like the MahApps leader, Paul Jenkins, he has a cracking beard
